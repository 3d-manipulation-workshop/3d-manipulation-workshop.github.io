Date: May 17th, 2024
Time: 9am - 6pm

## About

In order for robots to be capable of manipulating a wide range of novel objects in unstructured environments, they must have the ability to perceive and reason about 3D geometry. By doing so, robots will then be able to use its 3D visual information to better inform actions that it can execute in the 3D world. However, there are a number of challenges we must overcome. These challenges include: how to acquire and represent 3D information, and how to learn 3D representations which are useful for manipulation agents. Ultimately, we hope this workshop will help the community make progress towards understanding how we can build more generalist manipulation agents.
