## Running the website locally.

### Prerequisites

Install Hugo (the static site generator):

```
# [On macOS]
brew install hugo
brew install sass/sass/sass
```

### Run the site locally.

Make sure you clone the git repo recursively to get the template submodule:
```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:3d-manipulation-workshop/3d-manipulation-workshop.github.io.git
```


In the root of this website directory:
```
cd 3d-manipulation-workshop.github.io
hugo server
```

## Editing the site.

The main home page is on `layouts/index.html`. You can edit that directly.
